# Plus1 Labs Intern Day Part 2

### Hello User!

1. Set up a database for your project.
2. Satisfy the following requirements:
* The user should navigate to your application's URL and see a simple welcome screen and registration form, with the option of skipping to a login form.
* Registration form
    * The user should be able to submit valid personal details.
    * The user's information should be received and persisted to a database by a backend web service.
* Login form
    * The user should be able to enter a valid username present in the database to log in.
    * Let's assume our users are ultra-trustworthy; no passwords or auth tokens needed.
* After registration or login, the user should be taken to a placeholder main page with "Welcome {username}!" at the top. This will be expanded on in the next challenge.
