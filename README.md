# Plus1 Labs Intern Day Part 2

### Hello User!

1. Set up a database for your project.
2. Satisfy the following requirements:
* The user should navigate to your application's URL and see a simple welcome screen and registration form.
* The user should be able to submit valid personal details.
* The user's information should be received and persisted by a backend web service.

Don't worry about authorization; assume it is already handled.
